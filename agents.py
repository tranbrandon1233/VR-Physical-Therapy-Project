    VR Game for Forearm Flexors - virtual gardening

    Targeted Muscles: Flexor carpi radialis, Flexor carpi ulnaris, Flexor digitorum superficialis (muscles along the inner side of the forearm responsible for wrist and finger flexion).
    Game Concept: Players engage in virtual gardening tasks like pulling weeds (grass), which require gripping and wrist flexion.
    Adjustability:
    Easier: Objects are larger and closer to the user.
    Harder: Objects are smaller and positioned further away, requiring more precise and extended movements.

    Gameflow and scene: 
    The user can see grass in front of them. They use either their right or left hand to pick up grass. 
    The user is sitting down. 
    There are a number of weed grass placed on the mud in the VR world. 

    The data you get: Number of plants, distance from global origin (x,y,z) of every plant, Size of grass, and time left passed/elapsed.

    A SOAP note is a form of written documentation many healthcare professions use to record a patient or client interaction. Because SOAP notes are employed by a broad range of fields with different patient/client care objectives, their ideal format can differ substantially between fields, workplaces, and even within departments. However, all SOAP notes should include Subjective, Objective, Assessment, and Plan sections, hence the acronym SOAP. A SOAP note should convey information from a session that the writer feels is relevant for other healthcare professionals to provide appropriate treatment. The audience of SOAP notes generally consists of other healthcare providers both within the writerâ€™s own field as well in related fields but can also include readers such as those associated with insurance companies and litigation. A good SOAP note should result in improved quality of patient care by helping healthcare professionals better document and therefore recall and apply details about a specific case.

    How long is a SOAP note and how do I style one?
    The length and style of a SOAP note will vary depending on oneâ€™s field, individual workplace, and job requirements. SOAP notes can be written in full sentence paragraph form or as an organized list of sentences fragments. Note the difference in style and format in the following two examples. The first come from within a hospital context. The second is an example from a mental health counseling setting.
